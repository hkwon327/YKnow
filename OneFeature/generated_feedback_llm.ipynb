The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, has significantly increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, intensifying the natural greenhouse effect. This has caused global temperatures to rise, leading to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events like hurricanes and heatwaves. Ecosystems and human societies are already feeling the impacts of these changes.\n","Energy production, transportation, industrial processes, and agriculture are the primary sources of carbon emissions. Fossil fuel reliance for electricity, heating, and transportation is a major contributor, while deforestation and livestock farming also exacerbate the issue. Addressing these emissions requires a shift to renewable energy sources, improved energy efficiency, and widespread adoption of sustainable practices. On a global scale, agreements like the Paris Climate Accord emphasize the importance of international collaboration to curb emissions.\n","While the challenges are immense, solutions are within reach. Transitioning to renewable energy, reducing consumption, and supporting green technologies can mitigate the worst effects of global warming. The climate crisis demands urgent and collective action, as the future of the planet and its inhabitants depends on the choices made today.\n","'''"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"vFWnSiTXQ1Lb"},"outputs":[],"source":["# instruction to provide additional viewpoints\n","system_prompt_opposing_viewpoints = '''You are a critical writer tasked with analyzing the user's essay.\n","The user is seeking opposing viewpoints to challenge the arguments presented.\n","Review the essay carefully and construct well-reasoned opposing viewpoints according to the following rules:\n","\n","[Rules]\n","- Construct a minimum of three well-reasoned opposing viewpoints.\n","- Use the following response format: 1. ...: Explanation providing logical reasoning and context.\n","- The Main Point should be concise, expressed as a short phrase, sentence, or words.\n","- Number each response sequentially.\n","- Begin each response with the main point, followed by a clear and detailed explanation.\n","- Start directly with the main point.
